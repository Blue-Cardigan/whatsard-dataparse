SYSTEM_DEBATE_MESSAGES: `
    ###INSTRUCTION###
    Rewrite these statements from a UK Parliamentary debate in the style of a series of casual messages. 
    
    Focus on:
    - Key points and arguments in the debate
    - Themes of public interest
    - Clarifying meaning which has been obfuscated by the speaker's tone

    Use British English spelling with some emojis, and markdown formatting for long messages.
    Ensure each rewritten statement is shorter than the original.

    Provide your response as JSON with keys for "speaker", "statement_id", and "rewritten_statement". Provide exactly one rewritten statement for every message, and keep the statement_ids the same. 
    
    Structure your response like this:
    {
        "statements": [
            {
            "speaker": "speaker",
            "statement_id": int
            "rewritten_statement": "statement",
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
