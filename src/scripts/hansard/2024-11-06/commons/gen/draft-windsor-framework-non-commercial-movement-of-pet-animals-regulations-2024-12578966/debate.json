      "Value": "I beg to move,\r\n\r\nThat the Committee has considered the draft Windsor Framework (Non-Commercial Movement of Pet Animals) Regulations 2024.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to serve under your chairwomanship, Ms Vaz. This instrument was laid before the House for consideration on 10 October this year. Its purpose is to implement arrangements under the Windsor framework announced in February last year. It provides for the introduction of the Northern Ireland pet travel scheme. The framework significantly improves on the arrangements under the original Northern Ireland protocol and represents an important step forward for the people of Northern Ireland. This Government have been very clear in their intention to secure new, better arrangements for sanitary and phytosanitary matters with the EU. We are clear that we want to continue to simplify that process in order to support those across the United Kingdom while protecting our internal market.\r\n\r\nTurning to the statutory instrument itself, the Northern Ireland pet travel scheme will significantly simplify the requirements associated with moving pet dogs, cats and ferrets from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. It replaces single-use animal health certificates with a lifelong travel document that is free of charge and removes the need for costly pet-health treatments. Pet owners who travel frequently with their pets and those who rely on the service of an assistance dog to travel independently will benefit substantially from this change in approach.\r\n\r\nThe SI will also benefit the movement of pets for other reasons, such as the movement of young assistance dogs into Northern Ireland for training or of police or military working dogs from GB to Northern Ireland. I am pleased to say that that benefit has been recognised by Guide Dogs UK, which has noted the positive impact of removing single-use EU certificates for assistance dog owners travelling into Northern Ireland. The SI also reaffirms the Government’s commitment to unfettered access: there will be no requirements whatsoever for pets from Northern Ireland beyond the need for a microchip, as is good practice already and in line with the Government’s approach to high animal welfare standards.\r\n\r\nFinally, the SI empowers relevant competent authorities to carry out their respective responsibilities as part of the scheme in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That will ensure that the scheme is sufficiently robust and that those travelling with their pets have the best experience possible.<span id=\"4\" class=\"column-number\" data-column-number=\"4\"></span>\r\n\r\nIn summary, the instrument is essential in implementing the benefits of the Windsor framework, an international treaty negotiated by the last Government which this Government have committed to delivering in good faith. The Windsor framework is successfully restoring the smooth flow of trade within the UK internal market by removing the burdens that have disrupted east-west trade, as well as safeguarding Northern Ireland’s place in the Union. I hope Committee members agree that the Northern Ireland pet travel scheme delivers significant benefits for pet owners and assistance dog users across the UK, and I urge all to support its implementation.",

      "Value": "It is lovely to see you in the Chair, Ms Vaz. I agree that the statutory instrument represents an improvement on what has gone before. Pet-owning families will not be exposed to costly and time-consuming veterinary certification, nor will they have to ensure that animals are rabies-vaccinated or examined for tapeworms. I am glad to see that the regulations apply not only to cats and dogs, but to ferrets. As a former ferret owner, I am reassured that ferrets are being properly represented in this House.\r\n\r\nThe single document lasts a lifetime. I have personal experience of bringing a couple of dogs across the Irish sea, and being treated as coming from a third country brings significant costs and delays for pet owners. With these improvements, and in the interests of not creating increased uncertainty for pet owners across the country, I support these regulations. However, I am aware that a number of pet owners have some concerns, and I would like to seek reassurance and clarification from the Minister. A number of pet owners are deeply concerned that this change will prevent or hinder them from travelling freely to Northern Ireland, and I fear that has been exacerbated by the lack of a full public consultation. Will the Minister explain why a public consultation was not undertaken and what steps will she and the Department take to reassure pet owners more fully about the impact of these changes on them?\r\n\r\nOn a much more serious point, the regulatory regime that underpins this legislation is the responsibility of, and open to future amendments by, the European Union. Will the Minister reassure me that the European regulations to which these regulations operate in reference will continue to be monitored closely by His Majesty’s Government? Will the Government give an undertaking that this legislation will be revisited, should the underlying regulations change to the detriment of the UK and its citizens who want to travel to Northern Ireland?\r\n\r\nIt is also concerning that full EU entry requirements will remain in place for individuals moving from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland, as if they were travelling from a third country. That implies that SPS border checks would be required between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Will the Minister clarify whether that is the case, and whether this statutory instrument introduces any measures to ensure that the Irish border—the land border between the north and south on the island of Ireland—remains without a physical border and without physical checks for pet owners?",

      "Value": "I urge the Committee to reject these regulations. I take issue with the Minister saying that this is an improvement. The original propositions <span id=\"5\" class=\"column-number\" data-column-number=\"5\"></span>of the protocol were never implemented. The grace periods remain the current position, which is that no pet passports, no documentation and no requirement to be part of a pet scheme is needed to bring your pet from GB to the other part of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nWhat these regulations do is impose a pet passport scheme. People must belong to a pet scheme and submit their dog, cat or ferret to documentary and identity checks on getting on the boat and on leaving the boat—all that is within the one country. All that is because, for the first time since Brexit, the EU has legislated for the United Kingdom. I want that to sink in. What these regulations do is impose EU regulation 2023/1231. Let me read the title of that measure, which is a regulation of the European Parliament, not of this Parliament, and of the Council:\r\n\r\n“Regulation (EU) 2023/1231 on specific rules relating to the entry into Northern Ireland from other parts of the United Kingdom of certain consignments of retail goods, plants for planting, seed potatoes, machinery and certain vehicles operated for agricultural or forestry purposes, as well as non-commercial movements of certain pet animals into Northern Ireland”.\r\n\r\nThese regulations impose that foreign-made regulation, made not for the EU—it is not applicable to the EU—but for this United Kingdom. How is it that we have got to the point that this Committee is expected merely to nod to legislation made not by this House, for this United Kingdom? It is not that it is imposing obligations unique to Northern Ireland; it is imposing obligations on GB citizens, who want to bring their pet to visit family, the Giant’s Causeway or the many tourist attractions in Northern Ireland. Now, courtesy of the demands of this foreign EU legislation, they must belong to a pet scheme, apply for and obtain a pet passport, subject their pet to document and identity checks, and then—and only then—can they move their pet internally within the United Kingdom. That is an astounding situation, and an astounding imposition on citizens of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAs I read the regulations, that imposition extends even to guide dogs. Think about it. If someone who needs a guide dog comes from GB to visit a relative in my constituency or elsewhere, or the Giant’s Causeway in my constituency, they must have a pet passport. Why? Not because of regulations made by this House, but because legislation passed by the EU says that he or she must have one. Many guide dogs are reared in Northern Ireland for GB use. They are trained in Northern Ireland, and every one of them will be subject to this unnecessary regulation.\r\n\r\nWe are told that it is all to protect the EU market. We are told that we cannot have an SPS border where it should be—where the actual border is—but we must have it in the Irish sea. The farce of these regulations is that if someone brings their dog from GB to Northern Ireland, and wants to visit Donegal or Dublin across the border, then they must subject themselves to a full SPS border where we were told it cannot be—at the actual border. How farcical is that? We cannot have an SPS border where it should be. We must therefore impose restrictions on animals coming from GB to Northern Ireland, but if we take a dog onwards to the Republic, then yes, we are subject to full SPS checks. Where? Where we are told we cannot even have an SPS border. <span id=\"6\" class=\"column-number\" data-column-number=\"6\"></span>\r\n\r\nThe other dimension of the regulations, and the subservience that we are invited to submit ourselves to, is that if the EU is dissatisfied with the United Kingdom’s implementation of them, then under EU regulation, it can suspend them or take whatever steps it wishes. What this Parliament has been asked to do, on behalf of its citizens—primarily its GB citizens—is put them at the mercy of the EU’s regulations, not United Kingdom registration, which could allow their animal to be put into quarantine. Indeed, under the regulations, if an animal fails the document or identify check, it has to go into SPS custody. I assume that means it goes into quarantine, in its own country. Little wonder the other place debated these regulations. I have initiated an early-day motion for this House to debate them. I suspect it will not, but it certainly should, because they are a fundamental assault on basic freedoms.\r\n\r\nThe other point to stress is that most other things governed by the Irish sea border are governed under the pretext that they are commercial. This is the extension of the Irish sea border to the non-commercial movement of pets. Why should that be? We are told that this improves the present situation, but I have already explained why it does not: the present situation is free movement.\r\n\r\nAt present, cats and ferrets do not need to be microchipped—yes, dogs need to be microchipped, but not cats or ferrets. Under these regulations, cats, ferrets and dogs must all be microchipped to move within this United Kingdom. Frankly, that is a step far too far. The Committee should take a stand and say, “We cannot—we will not—put this upon our citizens.” Why should we, if all someone is doing is bringing their best friend—their dog—with them within the United Kingdom? That is why I invite the Committee not to approve the regulations.\r\n\r\nI raise considerable concern that there was no impact assessment on the regulations on the fatuous grounds that they were less severe than they might have been— that is no comfort; there should have been an impact assessment—and because, equally fatuously, there is no impact on business. Of course there is not—the movements are non-commercial. It is all the worse that we have now got to the point where non-commercial movements are being dictated to us under regulations.\r\n\r\nAs the hon. Member for Broadland and Fakenham said, there was no public consultation. Why not? These regulations affect every dog, cat and ferret owner in Great Britain. Should there not have been a public consultation, particularly as they affect every guide dog owner? That is where it really cuts to the quick. I say to the Committee that the case is not made for these regulations and they should be taken back, because to go down this road is to take a step far too far in being subservient to a foreign Parliament telling us what people in this country can do with their dogs, cats and ferrets.",

      "Value": "I am grateful for the contributions in today’s debate. I am confident that the Committee will agree that we could not have a debate about pets without the mention of some of our beloved pets—after all, we are a nation of animal lovers. This allows me to mention for the first time my two new kittens. My beloved cat, Thomas, became quite famous after being mentioned <span id=\"7\" class=\"column-number\" data-column-number=\"7\"></span>by me, but sadly passed away. We now have the terrible two, Meglatron and Lily, who are enjoying spending time with the family.\r\n\r\nI will give Cats Protection a bit of a plug, having got my pets from them. In England, cats need to be microchipped before they are five months old. That has been a requirement since June 2024, so anyone who is seeking to get a cat from Cats Protection or anywhere else will find that it is a legal requirement for the cat to be microchipped.\r\n\r\nNow that I have given my animals a shameless plug I will turn to the points made in the debate. I thank the hon. Member for Broadland and Fakenham for agreeing to support the measure and for the tone of his remarks. I gently point out that, yes, there are not any checks at the moment, but that is because this is a continuation of the situation when we were a member of the European Union. We are no longer a member. Brexit has taken place, and with that came the Windsor framework. The aim of the original Northern Ireland protocol and the framework was to avoid the need for any hard border, as I am sure the hon. and learned Member for North Antrim knows, in the island of Ireland, between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The scheme safeguards that position. The position that he advocates is one that does not exist—we are not a member of the European Union. We are fulfilling our requirements under the Windsor framework, because the Government believe in our international obligations. We believe in keeping our word and in fulfilling our obligations. When we make an agreement, as with the Windsor framework, we fulfil that agreement, and do everything we can to ensure that that is done in good faith.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, pets need to be microchipped. That is a legal requirement in England. It is considered good practice, and is part of the Government’s commitment to world-leading standards in companion animal welfare. The measure reflects existing requirements and practice.\r\n\r\nOn the question of public consultation, the UK Government have engaged comprehensively with interested stakeholders, and we used research from pet owners, ferry and airline companies operating travel routes between GB and Northern Ireland, and commercially owned pet microchip database operators in drafting the regulations. Guide Dogs UK, as I have mentioned, has highlighted the positive impact of removing single-use EU certificates for assistance dog owners travelling to Northern Ireland, <span id=\"8\" class=\"column-number\" data-column-number=\"8\"></span>as has the British Veterinary Association, and has outlined the fact that the arrangement will reduce paperwork for vets on pet health treatment. There is no change in the requirements on travel between Northern Ireland and Ireland. I reassure the hon. and learned Member for North Antrim that we will, of course, monitor everything closely. I hope that that offers him some reassurance—any changes will come back to the House.\r\n\r\nIn response to the suggestion that the scheme will be more burdensome for the public, the new arrangements will create a cheaper and smoother experience for people travelling with their pet from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, because it removes the need for pet health treatments. The scheme does not require pet health treatments that are costly because it recognises the rabies-free status of the UK. In addition, the pet travel document is free, simple and quick to apply for online, and lasts for the lifetime of the pet.\r\n\r\nOn the question of the checking regime, I must make it clear that Northern Ireland pet owners will not face any checks. There will be no checks for pets travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, and there will be no checks when ferries arrive in Northern Ireland. The scheme must ensure that GB pet owners have a valid pet travel document to mitigate abuse of the scheme. The new arrangement creates a smoother experience than the current legal requirements and is a significant improvement—this Government like to fulfil requirements —on those under the old Northern Ireland protocol. Those are the current legal requirements; the instrument improves on them.\r\n\r\nThe Windsor framework provides capacity for the smooth passage of goods and pets from Northern Ireland to Great Britain while protecting the integrity of the island of Ireland. The instrument implements arrangements agreed under the Windsor framework, significantly improving existing legal arrangements for pet travel between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nMay I conclude by summarising the benefits of the new Northern Ireland pet travel scheme? It is a sustainable and durable framework for non-commercial pet travel between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It secures the smooth movement of pets within the UK and removes costs, pet health treatments and red tape. I thank all Members for their contributions.\r\n\r\n<em>Question put and agreed to.</em>",
