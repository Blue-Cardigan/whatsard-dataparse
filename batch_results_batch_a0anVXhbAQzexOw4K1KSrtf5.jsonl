Why? Because kids are struggling big time with mental health, and getting help is a nightmare! \ud83d\ude22 Parents and headteachers keep telling me how bad it is, with teachers acting like superheroes without the backup they need. \ud83d\udea8 Mental health for youngsters was a mess even before COVID-19, and now it's worse! \\n\\nDid you know 1 in 5 kids, aged 7-16, probably has a mental health issue? Imagine if that many had a physical illness like diabetes\u2014there'd be uproar! We need to treat mental and physical health the same. Early support is super important. Half of all lifetime mental health conditions show up by 14. Jumping in early can stop things getting worse. \\n\\nThere are stories across the board, like Nicole, who waited ages for help that didn't come, leaving her feeling stuck and hurting. The government doesn't even keep track of how much they're spending on young people's mental health. Truth is, they seem to see kids as a 'money drain,' which is just wrong. Investing in kids' mental health is investing in our future. \ud83d\udca1\\n\\nMental Health Support Teams (MHSTs) in schools are a start but they're stretched too thin! For crying out loud, half of secondary and three-quarters of primary schools haven't got any MHSTs. The job lands on teachers who are already swamped. Some schools scrimping for any support now have to cut back. That's why my plan is for this to be a funded requirement, using the 'polluter pays' idea by slapping more taxes on social media giants who added to these problems.\\n\\nMissing out on school because of mental health is a big deal. New data shows it. Over a fifth of kids waiting for mental health support have skipped more than half a year of school! This leads to more problems like stopping hobbies and avoiding friends. Schools see these kids stuck, barely leaving home, and know that onsite mental health help could've kept them in class. It's happening too much. \\n\\nThis is our chance to fix things: put a mental health pro in every school, make support easy to get and stop problems early. Long term, it'll help the NHS save money, but more importantly, it helps kids grow up healthier and happier. \ud83c\udfaf This proposal is vital for our future\u2014a message reinforced by groups like YoungMinds and Barnardo\u2019s.

It's just heartbreaking, and my thoughts are with them all. Now, let's chat housing! Building more homes is our big project because it powers up the economy and lifts everyone's living standards. It also helps us deal with public service challenges. I'm rolling out a bold plan to sort out the housing crisis. We need to get building pronto\u2014no faffing around. Yes, it may ruffle some feathers, but we\u2019ve dodged the issue for too long. \ud83c\udfe1\\n\\nHere\u2019s the lowdown: 150,000 kids are in temporary homes, there are 1.3 million households waiting on social housing, and younger folks have fewer chances to own homes now compared to the \u201890s. Rents are soaring at 8.6%, and homelessness is at record heights! The old Tory crew knew about this but sat on their hands. They bragged about making 1 million homes but never even hit their yearly goal of 300,000 homes. Worse, housing targets were made voluntary to placate opposition. Result? We\u2019re slipping below 200,000 new homes a year. Shocking, right?\\n\\nWe\u2019re taking charge! Labour's fixing the mess with mandatory housing targets for local areas. It's not just about how many new homes are needed but ensuring it respects local views. We're also upgrading the method to figure out housing needs so it\u2019s based on up-to-date info, and we\u2019ll factor in where house prices don\u2019t match local incomes. We're bumping targets from 300,000 to 370,000 homes annually. Some won't like it, but fair's fair\u2014everyone has to pitch in.\\n\\nOn the green belt: Let\u2019s use dodgy, underused land first. Councils might need to review the greenbelt for housing needs, but they must focus on poorly maintained spots, with clear criteria on what to build. If greenbelt is developed, the community gets 50% affordable housing\u2014which includes social rents\u2014plus schools, GP surgeries, transport, and improved green spaces. Previously, things got built in all the wrong places with no local services\u2014No more of that!\\n\\nFor truly affordable homes, developers need to move at our pace, and we call on councils and housing folks to back a council house revolution. We\u2019ll bring flexibility into the current affordable homes programme, working with Homes England. We\u2019re pushing for the biggest social and affordable housing boost in generations. In short, we need this to happen\u2014now!\\n\\nMaintaining existing stock is vital too, so we\u2019re tweaking the right to buy. We\u2019re enhancing council flexibilities with the money from Right to Buy to ensure home supply for vulnerable folks.\\n\\nOur wider growth plan is intertwined with building the homes and infrastructure\u2014such as labs, factories, data centers, clean energy\u2014and leaving the Tory ban on onshore wind behind. We've set rules for solar developments and clearer expectations for renewable energy sites.\\n\\nUltimately, every local council needs a development plan\u2014currently, only a third do. These plans are key for community input and averting speculative developments. We\u2019re clearing the planning policy mess and striving for universal plan coverage because communities need a voice in development.\\n\\nWith this transformative agenda, I'll be tracking our progress against a 13-week target personally. We owe it to 1.5 million new homes to get this right!

Echoing Angela on yesterday\u2019s Southport tragedy\u2014our hearts go out. Well, Angela\u2019s laid out her housing master plan, which raises a load of questions. Today, we won\u2019t solve them all, but answers would be fab before summer break if possible. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nLabour\u2019s got the mandate from the election to make these changes, and our role as opposition is to double-check Labour\u2019s sticking to its promises\u2014no smoke and mirrors allowed!

How\u2019ll Labour avoid the years of uncertainty? These changes need solid grounding, which Angela claims, but there\u2019s unavoidable turbulence when shifting building policies.\\n\\nThe targets for housing in London seem to be scaled back? Is this happening elsewhere too? Cities like London have the infrastructure for housing expansion, so why the change from a nearly 100,000 home goal to now just 80,000? How\u2019s that helping when inner-city schools are shutting due to low student numbers?\\n\\nThis grey belt and Right to Buy stuff need clarity. Does Angela plan to restrict right to buy, meaning today\u2019s youth can\u2019t enjoy discounts she had? Also, councillors are worried their green areas might end up sacrificed for urban demands. What will be there to reassure them?\\n\\nAngela dipped into beauty and quality of housing. It seems Labour's skimping on well-designed 'beautiful' homes that communities crave. Why stress speed over style?\\n\\nAnd let\u2019s talk dosh; where's the financial analysis? We all saw the fiscal mess addressed this week, so any plan needs money-chat upfront. How can new revenues and expenses align to prevent frustrating public finances more?\\n\\nThose are just a few questions.

Affordable housing faced a similar banjax, so we\u2019re working to retrieve funds and apply them effectively with Homes England.

My heart goes out to those families. It\u2019s a terrible attack that shows reckless disregard for life, and we\u2019re condemning it full stop. This kind of fighting\u2019s been escalating around the Israeli-Lebanese border and it\u2019s a real tinderbox.

So, I'm bringing up a proposal called 'Ella\u2019s Law' to make this happen. \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udc76\\n\\nHere's the deal: In 2013, a young girl named Ella tragically died due to an asthma attack caused by air pollution. Her case is heartbreaking but also highlighted the issue. Ella's mum, Rosamund, has been an incredible advocate for clean air, and I'm honoured to name this Bill after Ella.\\n\\nAir pollution is a big health issue. It can cause asthma, heart disease, and even mental health issues like anxiety and depression. The worst part? It's worse for those who earn less or are from diverse ethnic backgrounds because they\u2019re more likely to live in polluted areas. Kids are especially affected. \ud83d\udeb8\\n\\nThere\u2019s some crazy numbers too! Nearly 3 million Londoners live near busy roads where pollution is insane. Studies show that if we clean up the air, we can save up to 43,000 lives every year and save the NHS billions! \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\nHowever, the government's current plans aren\u2019t cutting it. They say they have \u2018world-leading\u2019 measures, but they\u2019re not ambitious enough. They aim for pollution levels that experts say we could surpass way faster\u2014like by 2030 instead of 2040. Plus, experts have shared evidence that meeting stricter targets could save kids\u2019 lives! \ud83d\udebc\\n\\nMy proposed Bill, Ella\u2019s Law, aims to give everyone the right to clean air and hold the Government accountable. The idea is to legally ensure that every public decision considers clean air as a basic human right. It would require efforts based on guidelines from experts like the World Health Organisation. We'd also form a citizens commission to keep track of the progress and make necessary improvements. \ud83d\udcc8\\n\\nThis has been discussed a lot, even getting cross-party support. It's time for the Government to take the lead on this very real public health emergency. I\u2019m encouraging them to seize this golden chance to be world leaders in clean air policy and protect lives!\\n\\nThanks to everyone else supporting the Bill, including Mr Barry Sheerman, Layla Moran, and more.

Yep, we're on about Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, once more. So, what's the gist? First off, there's actually been a good bit of cash from the Government since 2019, to the tune of \u00a3411 million for Sandwell, despite the council going on about \u00a3105 million they apparently don't have. That's things like \u00a365 million in town deals, with a chunk going to Tipton and Wednesbury. It sounds great, but the council isn't really spending it well. Why? That\u2019s the big question \u2013 you'd think they'd want to see some benefits already.  \\n   \\nBut here's the tricky bit: governance is iffy. My town's folks are buzzing about community and getting involved to fix stuff, like when we saved the Walker Grange care home \u2013 that happened because we dug into the council's budget and found a sneaky \u00a32 million underspend. Oh, and don't get me started on how people were told they'd lose their kids' transport for speaking up. It's like something out of a dodgy sitcom! \ud83d\ude44  \\n   \\nLook, the child's social services needed improvements and all, but we\u2019re still waiting on them sorting housing problems and asking why rogue developers weren\u2019t kept in check properly. There's also a \u00a3650 million, 25-year bin contract which makes no sense because they want to cut collections to every two weeks. When last year\u2019s strike happened, it was the community that stood up to oppose it, not the council. The council blames the Tories for the past 14 years but hold on \u2013 Labour's been in charge of Sandwell for 50 years! If your bin ain't collected, or your streets aren't safe, maybe ask the local Labour council what's up.  \\n   \\nMarch 2022 was the kicker \u2013 we needed backup, and thankfully got help. Since then, thanks to some fresh faces and attention from the Government, there's a glimmer of hope. But listen, Sandwell\u2019s still one of the most deprived areas out there, and folks deserve so much better. My big idea? Scrap Sandwell altogether! It's not a real place anyway, just a council made up in the '70s. Instead, let's celebrate local town pride and keep things efficient.  \\n   \\nWe need a structure that ensures all areas are properly looked after, and I'm looking forward to what the Minister has to say about all this when he visits.

It's time they owned it. \ud83d\ude24  \\n   \\nAlthough there's loads of funding pouring in from the Government into our zones, it's frustrating 'coz we're not seeing much action on the ground, are we? I snagged \u00a33 million for a high street spruce-up for Wednesfield \u2013 you've seen the spot \u2013 but nearly three years on and the Labour council hasn't even drawn up a plan.

Sandwell\u2019s got \u00a3110.5 million tucked away and loads more funding slotted in. Suggesting it's all down to a stingy government isn't just incorrect. The council's needed serious fixing for a while \u2013 their own issues with leadership and culture led to dodgy decisions and weak services. Things got so out of hand that commissioners were sent in to help.  \\n   \\nBut there\u2019s hope \u2013 the council's making headway. And while they\u2019re not perfect, they\u2019re getting there. After the commissioners step back, the Local Government Association will keep an eye out to ensure things don't slip back.  \\n   \\nAs for scrapping Sandwell, well, changes have to come from the community up, with solid backing. A sudden re-jig now might just be distracting. The focus should stick on empowering towns and keeping improvements rolling. Look, we're throwing cash and effort into Sandwell because we care.

I kicked this off with a quick ten-minute Bill last June, but it didn\u2019t get picked up last session, so let's give it another go! It's gained a bunch of support from all around, especially some big names in the House. The Bill aims to push the Secretary of State to report on giving financial help to parents whose kids are stuck in hospital for ages. Big shoutout to the Ministers who've been keen to chat about it, especially my mate Jo Churchill who's got personal experience on this kind of stuff. \\n\\nThis all started when Ceri Menai-Davis, one of my constituents, got in touch after his son Hugh, just six, passed away from a rare cancer. Ceri and his wife Frances, who are here today, went through hell, visiting the hospital daily to be with their son as he went from a sporty kid to leaving us. They\u2019ve set up a charity, **It\u2019s Never You**, to help other parents going through this trauma, offering mental and physical support, and they're looking for some financial help as well.\\n\\nThe numbers aren't huge\u2014around 4,000 kids a year spend over two months in hospital. These parents are footing daily visits or staying over and incurring loads of costs. Ceri asked if I'd help them meet a Health Minister to talk better support for parents, and I got them in the room with Edward Argar, the then Minister of State. We walked him through all the practical issues, like getting food on weekends and mental support. He was pretty helpful and is tying this into the new children's hospitals that are being planned.\\n\\nCeri\u2019s charity links parents of sick kids to a supportive community and provides info via a blog and app, not handled by the authorities. They\u2019re also handing out well-being bags in hospitals across the UK. And oh! A shoutout to Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge, our local, which is working on a mega new children's hospital project, binding mental and physical health together.\\n\\nIn October, the new hospital plans went a step forward. It's about delivering top research mixed with medical care. Provisions like specialist wards and up-to-date treatment technology putting kids and families front and centre. Hats off to Matt Hancock for approving it. Ceri\u2019s insights have been great to the planning team over there.\\n\\nBeyond the money side, we need better cancer care. Back in November 2021, I spoke about little Jessica Brady's case, who also left us due to a misdiagnosed rare cancer. We pressed the Government, delivering a petition with 213,000 signatures. There's a strong push to catch cancers early and bust diagnostic delays. Loads going on with rapid diagnostic centres and integrated care boards.\\n\\nCeri's financial worries highlight what many parents face. They end up losing jobs to be with their kids. We've been chatting to Work and Pensions and Health departments about this. There's some help like unpaid leave and universal credit adjustments, but more is definitely needed.\\n\\nThrough this Bill, I am asking for a proper report about possible financial aid for such parents. I want government to dive into the current policies, see how extra help could improve things, and involve various groups in consults to frame a holistic approach.\\n\\nThis could be Hugh\u2019s legacy, helping others facing the same fate. Let\u2019s call it \u201cHugh\u2019s Report\u201d.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"Jo Gideon\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Agree 100%!

Catch three-quarters of cancers early so 55,000 more people can survive them five years longer. Rapid diagnostic centres, new hospital services, and a focus on all ages and types of cancer are keys to a brighter future. \\n\\nBut let's talk finances: Parents with kids in hospital are often losing jobs to be there for their kids. Additional support could change lives, but current financial aid is a patchwork. This Bill wants to take it further, assess the system fully, and see how some extra support could positively impact parents and kids. Many charities, including those like Ceri\u2019s and Young Lives vs Cancer, have already flagged challenges like delayed NHS travel support. \\n\\nI\u2019d love to see those in charge directly speaking with parents like the Menai-Davis\u2019s.

Bet you didn't see that coming, right? Most businesses don't even know this yet, and let's be real, neither do most of our voters. I mean, is the Government even sure about this move? \\n\\nBrexit seems to be like a recurring nightmare\u2014just as you think you're getting better, boom, here comes another wave of nausea. Those fancy blue passports and pints of wine aren't exactly making up for the extra paperwork mountain we're facing now. No way am I saying let's go back to the EU, though. Who's got time for detailed treaty talks when this is already a big mess affecting tons of businesses and jobs? \\n\\nToday's topic: How's the Government managing our borders, and what does that mean for our food supply? The UK is already importing 46% of its food, which means we're only self-sufficient by 54%. We got our snacks from the EU last year: \u00a310 billion of fruits and veggies, \u00a36 billion of drinks, and the same with meat. Given that 90% of our dairy, beef, eggs, and pork come from the EU, it's no wonder Brexit's already smacking our food prices. Look at what LSE says\u2014Brexit, not Ukraine or the energy mess, is the guilty party driving up prices. \\n\\nAnd now we have these new import controls adding insult to injury. Less transport, complex customs, and smaller supply chains are pushing us to 'survive' on porridge, even if we're 100% self-reliant on oats. \ud83d\ude2c Let's not fool ourselves that other countries will save us. Even with free trade talks with six other countries, they can't match EU's food shipment levels. Plus, if you care about animal welfare, you'd want EU standards over Australia's or New Zealand's. Geography counts! More border red tape means higher prices and shortage warnings\u2014ouch! \\n\\nBrexit brought customs chaos 'cause we ditched the EU market, and we\u2019ve been threatening our new customs rules ever since. Businesses are losing it over the controls that keep getting delayed, and taxpayers are picking up the tab. Like, \u00a3700 million spent on empty border facilities\u2014is that really worth the chaos it's causing? In 12 days, importing pork, beef, or even frogs' legs, needs a health certificate and vet signature. Think of it as extra import costs. \\n\\nThe Government talked about a potential \u00a3520 million a year cost but now says the health certificates will be only \u00a3330 million. That's like me telling my kids they should be thankful I didn't take the bell on their Easter bunny after all! \ud83d\ude02\\n\\nBeyond health certificates, the Government\u2019s also probing into a charge to cover a border scheme called the 'common user charge,' starting in 100 days. Price suggestions range from \u00a343 or less or more. British businesses need to know if this is even happening\u2014like, pronto!\\n\\nRemember, the charges apply to each consignment, be it a lamb leg or a truckload of frogs' legs. 65% of incoming lorries carry multi-consignments (groupage), which means costs will go through the roof. Fact is, Brexit's bonfire of regulations is smouldering, choking small businesses.\\n\\nThere\u2019s a way out\u2014aligning vets with Europe, tapping the pan-Euro Mediterranean convention, or using EU hubs holding non-EU products. Get this, checking 30% of imports is what's planned. Come November, safety declarations for all EU imports will be the norm\u2014just perfect for causing a headache!\\n\\nNorthern Ireland's exceptions and 'not for EU' labels spotlight how tech hasn't eliminated trade barriers. Countries like Belgium have said they're done playing mystery games with U.K.'s trade rules.\\n\\nA scattering of 20+ import measures coming soon means long ques and delivery hurdles\u2014Dover's set to be one giant lorry park. Logistics UK's Nichola Mallon warns of delays, traffic, rising prices, and less choice for us consumers. We get why checks are needed (think African swine flu) but are we alert enough to stop complications before they start?\\n\\nMajor doubts abound among services. 70% of funding to Dover's health inspectors got cut, which hardly inspires confidence. I\u2019d love some answers from the Minister, like: Are lorry checks happening in 12 days? Will there be enough vets for certificates? If not, when will those start? Will ports be working round the clock, and how about those charges\u2014are they set? \\n\\nWhat will businesses need to pay per consignment? And for the tech side, is the 'single trade window' up to scratch? Let's not forget, Northern Ireland negotiates separately too. With UK-EU exports nosediving from 50ish% in 1999\u20132000 to just 42% in 2022, it's obvious global companies may just choose less challenging markets. \\n\\nThere's simply too much red tape. So, Minister, will imports be checked soon or delayed yet again?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"Rebecca Pow\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Big thanks to my colleague Stella for bringing up this hot topic. Implementing the first part of this border target operating model is a big step for the UK, and it's taken a lot of effort from the whole Government team. I\u2019m here to lay out what's happening and tackle some of Stella's concerns, but fair warning, she had a loooong list of questions. I\u2019ll try to address \u2019em all, and if I miss anything, I promise to send some detailed answers in writing too! \u270d\ufe0f \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nNow, folks, we don\u2019t have a choice but to introduce biosecurity controls on imports now that we've moved on from the EU\u2019s strict systems. We bear the responsibility of safeguarding our lands from risks like African swine fever, super bad for pigs, and Xylella, which would be devastating to plants. Picture that wipeout! \\n\\nBiosecurity isn't just about protecting our backyard, it also defends our exports and global trading relationships. Trade partners want to see robust biosecurity here, and that's where we can add extra controls if needed. Like swine fever? We went a step further back in 2022\u2014proof that we take these things seriously!\\n\\nThe border target operating model strikes a balance between robust controls and minimizing hassle for importers. During its creation, 10,000 folks joined our meetings, we got loads of written responses and feedback from SMEs, food retailers, you name it. All of that\u2019s factored into phase one, kicking off January 31st.\\n\\nWe're running a handy pilot project for shipments from EU and made logistics for groupage (multiple consignments in a single truck) simpler. So Lorries bringing a mix of goods can use a single export health certificate\u2014easy peasy! The main system will fully go live by April 30th, giving businesses ample time to smooth things over.\\n\\nBy 2025, when the UK border strategy reaches its peak, the model will use snazzy tech enhancing trade simplicity. The single trade window, on its way, means filling info only once\u2014talk about convenience!\\n\\nTo be clear, the single trade window's still in development, managed by His Majesty's Revenue and Customs. Our aim? An easier import process, keeping businesses' regulatory responsibilities light but effective for biosecurity.\\n\\nOur new system cuts through red tape, guides businesses, and creates better checks against disease threats. That includes ditching controls on low-risk goods we can\u2019t make ourselves like citrus and mangos. Don\u2019t even trip over them veggies; we\u2019re always on guard to tweak policies, focusing only on genuine threats. \\n\\nLots of chatter happened around costs. Compared to the 2022 import-model, our revamped method saves about \u00a3500 million annually! Some paperwork reduced and less inspections done remotely.\\n\\nRunning tight on time now, but touching back on some specific points from Stella... \ud83e\udd1e\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"Roger Gale\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Order, one at a time please!

If you're going to visit another MP's area for official stuff (not personal trips), you should let them know.

If you're talking about another area\u2019s issues in Parliament, give the local MP a heads up if you can. This applies to asking written questions too.\\n\\nRemember, your duty is to your own voters! Changes in boundaries don't kick in until the next election, so don\u2019t dive into someone else\u2019s patch until then.

For vulnerable kids, regular school is protective. An expert told me that attendance at alternative provisions is now below 60%. That's worrying as regular absence can expose kids to things like crime. A roundtable of experts I attended completely supported the Bill and shared insights on why absences are rising\u2014economic issues, relocation due to housing, and more. Interestingly, some ethnic groups with high levels of English as a second language have better attendance compared to others. Girls' attendance, especially in years 8-10, is falling due to lower self-esteem and mental well-being issues. The Government's online safety work is crucial here. \ud83c\udf10 COVID broke the unwritten bond between schools and families, and even teacher strikes may have added to the problem. Anecdotally, parents working from home find it challenging to get kids to school sometimes. The Bill aims to make the current non-mandatory school guidance mandatory, like having an attendance champion at every school. It'll make sure that the support doesn't vary depending on your postcode. It's not a catch-all, but it's a strong step to make sure that we give school attendance the priority it deserves.

With mental health support teams rolling out in schools, hopefully, the Minister can say more about that. Lastly, making schools publish their attendance policies will be a game-changer. It'll help teachers explain the importance of knowing the policy before picking what secondary school to attend. It gives schools a way to show parents that attending school is a must.

Sometimes we get people marching, sometimes it\u2019s MPs pushing their ideas, but sometimes it\u2019s the quiet, hardworking folks \ud83d\udcbc who just want to fix what\u2019s wrong. One of those folks, in my area, is Stephen Horne, and today I\u2019m here to support his cause\u2014ending age discrimination at work. Let\u2019s face it, when it comes to things like gender, race and religion, we\u2019ve got rules in place to protect people, but age discrimination is still a big problem. My friend Jo Gideon and I are totally on the same page about this. Ageism is super common\u2014like, one in three people say they've experienced it. \ud83d\ude1f We\u2019ve got this law that messes with people\u2019s work benefits once they hit retirement age, and it's time to scrap it. \ud83c\udfaf\\n\\nStephen\u2019s a train driver for Eurotunnel and after turning 66, he lost certain benefits like health insurance. Imagine doing the same job you did at 65 but with less pay and benefits just because you\u2019re a year older. Not right, right? \ud83d\ude24 If he gets sick now, he might wait longer for treatment compared to others at his workplace, and that\u2019s scary. But wait, this discrimination? It's legal. The Equality Act 2010 should shield older people from this, but there's a big exception that\u2019s allowing all this unfairness.\\n\\nWe must change this, as people are working longer since the pension age was raised. Stephen\u2019s bill is all about making sure older workers get the same deal everyone else does. Just like we\u2019ve fought for women's rights at work over many decades, it's time to stand up for older workers. Let\u2019s ensure they\u2019re treated fairly, like female employees who can now enjoy maternity leave thanks to the law.\\n\\nExcuses like 'oh, insurance gets pricier for older folks' just don\u2019t cut it \ud83d\ude45. Would we accept excluding people with health conditions from work benefits just because costs might rise? No way. We need to fight age discrimination with the same vigour. \ud83d\udcaa It doesn\u2019t make sense to penalise workers for something they can\u2019t control\u2014like getting older. Similarly, making things fairer for older workers might also mean certain payments to balance out benefits that they can\u2019t access anymore.\\n\\nIn these changing times, as more people work later in life, we need rules that are fair and offer equal treatment for everyone at work, no matter their age. Stephen\u2019s been pushing hard against his bosses for this change, and while it\u2019s been tough, I\u2019m optimistic. Apart from changing the law, we could make discriminatory insurance terms illegal, just outright. This is something we can fix, and it\u2019s crucial for our community's future. \ud83d\udcbc\ud83d\ude4c\\n\\nLet\u2019s pick this conversation back up on the 15th of March!\"\n        }\n    ]\n}", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2042, "completion_tokens": 641, "total_tokens": 2683}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ef095a7ef4"}}, "error": null}

Big thanks \ud83c\udf89 for looking out for the Jewish community in Birmingham and standing by Israel. It's hard for me to wrap my head around how immense the Holocaust was, you know? Every time you hear a story from someone who lived it, you get a glimpse, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Each person's story is unique, shaped by where they were born or even where they tried to hide when things got intense in Europe. We hear about those who watched loved ones die or made snap decisions that saved them or others.\\n\\nThe Holocaust wasn't just a number\u20146 million Jewish lives snuffed out\u2014it was a whole world of dreams and futures just gone. Fast forward to 7 October, it was the deadliest day for Jewish people since WWII. Met folks who've lost, like this brave 23-year-old who told us she lost 60 mates in one day! \ud83d\ude22 Just can't imagine that kind of loss.\\n\\nI wish I didn't have to compare anything to the Holocaust. There's no comparison. We have Israel now so this stuff doesn't ever happen again. But 7 October was serious, friends. Got to see the aftermath first-hand in Israel. Saw a display by survivors of the Nova festival, and it was honestly heartbreaking. Tables of shoes and clothes from folks who just came to dance \ud83c\udfb6 And it hit me right in the feels thinking of the heaps of shoes I saw at Auschwitz. Those were young women, just like me, who just went there to dance. It's chilling!\\n\\nWe say 'never again', but looking at antisemitism today and hearing some folks outright deny that anything happened on 7 October, it's shocking. This denial isn't just misunderstanding; it's a stubborn refusal to face facts, kind of like Holocaust denial. We all need to be more vocal against this hate so nothing like this ever gets close to happening again.

It's shocking that 79 years after the Holocaust, there are still attacks based solely on religion.\\n\\nI\u2019m super proud of the Government for sticking by Israel and the Jewish community. But what worries me about today's world is how quickly things can get unstable everywhere\u2014it's a reminder that freedom is super fragile.

Sadly, not everyone can say the same, especially even right here in the UK with Jews facing antisemitism \ud83d\ude14.\\n\\nHolocaust survivors are heroes \ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

It's something that I deeply respect and continue to learn from. But antisemitism, while rooted way back even before WWII, is still here with us today, which is troubling.\\n\\nTake lessons from the past, like how America's antisemitic attitudes grew worse with more Jewish immigrants. It shows hatred can find a foothold anywhere, particularly if voices of tolerance are silent.

Henry Ford \ud83c\udfed printing hateful stuff against Jews in his weekly newspaper is proof of how widespread this was. The Nazis weren't the only ones, but they did horrific things, like Kristallnacht, which marked a turn towards violence, and we know where that led...\\nIt's awfully sad that 80 years have passed and we\u2019re still dealing with this. We need to remember the struggle and reflect on today\u2019s rising hate. Let's stand with the Jewish community and ensure, 'Never again' becomes a reality, not just words.

Those Jewish communities were around for centuries, and it took intense Nazi propaganda to make their own neighbours turn away when Jews were sent on trains to the camps.\\n\\nHolocaust Memorial Day is also about remembering other genocides, like the Holodomor in Ukraine. Still, the sheer scale of the Nazi atrocities\u2014killing six million Jews and others who were targeted just for being different\u2014is hard to grasp. But let's not forget the heroes who helped, risking it all. \\n\\nWe should also reflect on historical mistakes, like Britain's reluctance to help Jewish refugees in the 1930s during its Mandate in Palestine. Different decisions could have saved many lives.\\n\\nWith antisemitism on the rise, it's so important to remind younger folks what it leads to. Visiting Yad Vashem in Jerusalem or the Nova exhibition in Tel Aviv provides deep, unsettling reminders. And seeing the 7 October footage literally haunts my sleep \ud83d\udc94. Let's learn from this, as Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis points out, throwing around words like 'genocide' misleads and insults true victims. Saying 'never again' means facing hate vigilantly.

But Uris\u2019s 'Exodus' talks about the tough situation many Jewish survivors faced, including the failure of the UK and other countries to accept them right after WWII. This made the case for Israel's statehood even stronger, considering Jewish populations had few places to go.\\n\\nNow, antisemitism isn't just stories from the past\u2014it's alive today. Young folks in my area sometimes face hostility simply for being Jewish. I've even dealt with incidents personally. Not long ago, 7 October felt personal too, with attacks in Israel\u2014I met Nathanel Young early in his life before he tragically died.\\n\\nToday\u2019s antisemitism isn\u2019t just out there\u2014it's local, too.

It's a stark reminder that freedoms can vanish if people aren't vigilant.

Sometimes we get a bit comfy with our freedoms, but we gotta stay vigilant and protect them, alongside being brave and vocal about it! We need courage for hope and opportunity, in defending what\u2019s precious.\\n\\nSeeing faces in the Holocaust memory spaces like Auschwitz gives a human touch to these incomprehensible numbers. Hard to forget those haunting images once you've seen them. \ud83d\ude14 Let's remember: man\u2019s inhumanity is an eternal shame.

I think it's time we make things a bit fairer for drivers. \ud83d\ude97 So here's what I propose:\\n\\n1. If you're caught going between 20 and 30 mph, you shouldn't get penalty points; instead, you should just go to a speed awareness course. If you repeat the offence, you go again. This is because hitting drivers with points and fines for minor speeding in these zones seems pretty harsh. The idea is to improve road safety without causing unnecessary penalties.\\n\\n2. For non-speeding offences caught by local councils, like when you mistakenly drive into a bus lane, you should get a warning the first time. Only if you get caught again at the same spot should you get a fine. We\u2019ve seen loads of cameras around, issuing millions of tickets and generating huge amounts of money from drivers... just look at London! It seems only right to give people the benefit of the doubt at first.\\n\\n3.

The UK is pushing for a temporary pause to help get aid in and hostages out, moving towards a permanent ceasefire.

We ran a survey, and 90% of our MPs say they want more ways to directly question these Lords Ministers. Almost everyone wants this to include department Q&A sessions, urgent questions, and formal statements. So yes, most of us prefer these checks happen in the main Commons room. Some folks worry that changing the rules just gives the green light for more senior Ministers from the Lords, but our job here is to focus on right now, not set up any future rules. We respect the Lords, they do great work, but nothing beats MPs questioning who\u2019s really in charge. It\u2019s our job and we need to make sure that every MP has a way to ask about foreign policy issues directly. Option to use Westminster Hall or Committee Room 14 was considered but nah, won't cut it. So the plan is to have these Lords Ministers come for Q&As and statements like regular Ministers, but they'll speak from the side, not the main spot in the House of Commons.

It's a rough time to bring it up, though. I just got back from Israel, where I visited a kibbutz called Kfar Azar. It's a place where people wanted peace with Gaza. But on 7 October, a lot of them were killed, and others have been captured. Those who survived went through immense cruelty and fear for their future, kinda like what happened during the Holocaust. In Gaza and Israel, people are scared, facing trauma and terror from bombardments and lack of aid. \\n\\nAs we remember the Holocaust, it\u2019s frustrating to think, 'Has the world really learned anything?' This year, we\u2019re focusing on how fragile freedom is. That theme is crucial\u2014it allows us to see how our freedom can easily be lost and how we need to protect others who flee persecution now.\\n\\nThis hits home for me because of my family's history. We lost relatives in the Holocaust, like my grandmother and uncle. Other family members got out just days before the war and went through hell. My granddad came to England in 1939 and wrote a diary that gives us a glimpse into those times. In it, he mentioned things like antisemitism here in the UK and being treated as an 'enemy alien'. It showed how fragile freedom was back then, and kinda still is today.\\n\\nFast forward to me. I came to the UK from Egypt stateless in 1949. My dad had some nasty encounters with antisemitism back home, so we left. After applying for British nationality, we went through some pretty intense questioning, which made my freedom feel really fragile. \\n\\nSo what's the takeaway? Freedom is never guaranteed, and it\u2019s essential to treat those escaping persecution with respect. We can't blame asylum seekers or use language that scares people. We need to stand firmly against genocide and remember that our efforts have to mean something.

The rules and practices today, designed to exclude asylum seekers, matter\u2014and so do the fees for visas and the refusal to let them work.\\n\\nThe hostility faced by my granddad echoes today.

Back in 1980, the government decided we needed these nukes to beef up NATO's deterrence and protect us. Fast forward to 2024, and global threats have only gotten more tangled and tricky, with countries like Russia, China, and North Korea not making it any easier! \ud83d\udca5 We're pouring a lot of moolah into this programme, upgrading to the latest Dreadnought subs, which will keep our deterrent afloat well into the future. It's not cheap at \u00a331 billion, but investing today saves us the nightmare of war tomorrow. Plus, it's not just about keeping the peace\u2014these projects fuel jobs around the UK, from Cumbria to Clyde.

We want to make sure the fish you buy isn't from dodgy or unsustainable sources. In the past, we've focused on saving forests, and now we're turning attention to the ocean \ud83c\udf0a. We've done some good stuff like banning bottom trawling (where those nets scrape the ocean floor and mess up marine life), but illegal fishing is still a big issue. \\n\\nSome stats for you: Illegal fishing, especially from places like China and Russia, is hurting small coastal communities and wiping out fish stocks. West Africa is suffering from this, with 40% of their fish caught illegally! That's billions of dollars lost and bad news for the environment. \\n\\nAlthough the UK and EU have tight rules, they're not enough. We also learnt when the Ukraine conflict started that loads of our fish, especially white fish, come from Russia. Alongside China, they're the big players in this illegal fishing game. But let\u2019s face it, we can't just rely on regulations alone. We gotta be smart and start tracking the supply chains of fish all the way to the checkout. Like how we've started doing with risky forest products.\\n\\nThe idea is simple: make sure when you're buying fish from supermarkets, they can say for sure it's caught in a good way. Businesses should do their homework (due diligence, if you like). It\u2019s basically about being green and making sure fish stocks in the UK and worldwide are sustainable, and that shady businesses aren't winning. \\n\\nI\u2019m super proud that the UK took the lead on forest risk products. Let\u2019s continue and make sure our fishy products are not depleting the oceans elsewhere.

We\u2019re making 10,000 more prison spaces by 2025 and aiming for 20,000 overall. Today, I want to talk about foreign national offenders (FNOs). We've got about 10,500 of them, which costs us around \u00a347,000 per prisoner yearly. That's quite a strain on our resources, huh? We\u2019re working hard to send these lawbreakers back to their countries; 4,000 were sent back last year, a 27% increase from the previous year. We've extended a scheme allowing us to deport eligible FNOs up to six months earlier. Also, we have a new agreement with Albania for sending their offenders back. And yes, we\u2019re also looking to rent prisons overseas like some European countries do! We\u2019re setting up a taskforce and adding 400 caseworkers to process these FNOs faster. Plus, we\u2019re using diplomatic channels to make deportation deals with countries like Italy. And we\u2019re ready to use our new powers under the Nationality and Borders Act to restrict visas from countries unhelpful in FNO removals. So that's the plan, and next year we aim to deport more than double the offenders than last year! \ud83d\ude24 On remand population, things got a bit tight since the pandemic. We could have released loads of prisoners due to Covid, as some countries did, but we didn\u2019t, which was the right move. We also resisted calls to change jury trials during Covid. Now, with more people awaiting trial, we\u2019re exploring remote bail hearings, adding more caseworkers, investing in a bail information service, and expanding accommodation with additional \u00a322 million funding. All probation services need to be on top form to make this work, and we're investing in them, too \u2013 \u00a3155 million a year and loads of new trainees. The goal is to focus efforts where they make the biggest impact. \ud83d\ude4c Thanks to everyone working in our justice system!

But only one puny paragraph in your whole statement about it? \ud83d\ude2e People who broke the law are getting out early \u2013 possibly a threat to law-abiding folks! This needs more transparency. When this scheme was announced, you said it was temporary, yet it seems it\u2019s being stretched without clear limits. I have questions: How many have been released? Which prisons are doing this? What kind of offenders are getting out early? Are stalkers and domestic abusers included? Why stretch it to 60 days and indefinitely? We need to see weekly data on this, not yearly after the next election! You did mention more pressure on the probation service with these releases. But what\u2019s the \u2018reset\u2019 you suggested? There\u2019s no extra money for probation to handle this. Rushing such measures increases public risk. Be honest, please\u2014admit the risks. How will you ensure probation services can assess risks properly? Any risk assessment done? How do you make sure inexperienced probation staff aren\u2019t overwhelmed? You claim progress on deporting FNOs, but it's far behind what was done in 2010 under Labour. Foreign offenders still living freely after release, so let\u2019s double staffing as a credible plan, instead of just four hundred new officers.

Why's this crucial? Well, the numbers speak for themselves: Less than half of autistic kids are happy at school, and a whopping 73% think their teachers don\u2019t get them. Only 20% can hit grade 5 or above in English and Maths GCSEs compared to 52% of all kiddos. Plus, autistic children are twice as likely to be kicked out of school! \ud83d\ude13\\n\\nSadly, things don't look up once they grow up. Just 29% of autistic adults have jobs, and even then, they earn about a third less than others. That\u2019s bonkers! With the right support, these kids can shine\u2014they\u2019ve got amazing attention to detail, creativity, and other cool skills. They deserve better support right from the start.\\n\\nDiagnosis needs to be early, but about 92% of kids face delays, waiting longer than the NHS's 13-week deadline. In Norfolk, from 2021 to Oct 2023, 1,141 kids under 18 were diagnosed, some waiting up to 10 years\u2014yikes! \ud83d\ude31 With signs of autism showing as early as 6 months, waiting longer just messes things up for them.\\n\\nTake Hayley Turner\u2019s story. Her son, Rocky, was struggling in a mainstream school because folks weren\u2019t trained to teach kids like him. She had to jump through so many hoops to get him into the right environment. And she\u2019s not alone\u2014many parents are in constant battles for their kids\u2019 education rights. The government's stats show that 98% of parents who challenge in court win! Imagine that! \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\nSo here's the plan: let's get teachers mandatory autism training. Right now, only a tiny fraction of primary and secondary teachers have even had half a day of training on this. This Bill encourages quick autism assessments and slashes diagnosis waiting times. It'll help teachers know when kids need a hand and create inclusive schools for everyone. \ud83c\udfeb\\n\\nThe government seems keen on improvements, aiming for every child to get a fitting education. \ud83e\udd1e My Bill aims to make this happen by ensuring all educators know how to support autistic kids.\\n\\nThanks to everyone who helped me with this Bill, and I urge the government to use it to make life better for autistic children.

It\u2019s been two years since Northern Ireland hasn't had a proper government to make decisions on important stuff like schools and hospitals. This is all because of issues with the Northern Ireland protocol. We\u2019ve replaced it with the Windsor framework, which is meant to be a good deal. But it's not enough on its own, so we've been chatting with Northern Ireland parties about getting things up and running again. Big shout out to Gavin Robinson for his good work, and we've got a plan to support Irish nationals applying for British citizenship too. \\n\\nOur plan to boost Northern Ireland includes four main things: We\u2019re securing Northern Ireland\u2019s spot in the UK and showing we\u2019re committed to power-sharing. We\u2019re scrapping the automatic EU law alignment. There\u2019s also a focus on strengthening trade within the UK, including some new legislation to keep Northern Irish goods flowing freely around the UK. We\u2019ve reached a quick deal with the EU on tariffs to help Northern Irish traders. We\u2019re setting up these new panels to keep things running smoothly. Chuffed to say there's over \u00a33 billion funding to help Northern Ireland\u2019s services and to address pay issues in the public sector.\\n\\nThe deal's a result of decent negotiations with figures like Jeffrey Donaldson who\u2019s been ace in standing up for Unionism.

It's all about making sure that police officers and some police employees tell us if they're part of certain clubs or groups. Think about those secret societies we've often joked about with funny handshakes \u2013 they're not just a laugh, they can be pretty powerful networks! In the UK, policing is about trust and fairness, right? So, we need transparency in our police forces. A recent report from the Casey Report really hit home how crucial checks and transparency are. \ud83d\ude07 \\n\\nThis Bill will push for a public register where officers and police staff disclose memberships. It's not a new idea either! Back in '97, there was talk about needing a register for secret societies like Freemasons, and the Home Office even agreed with it the following year! There's always been chatter about the influence of Freemasons in policing \u2013 no accusations here, but it gets people curious. \ud83e\udd14 \\n\\nBut my Bill isn't just about Freemasons. It's about any group that acts like an exclusive club, which can be found in police culture. We've been hearing tons about issues like racism and corruption in the police. For real reform, we can't leave any stone unturned, my friends. And let's be clear, I'm not saying folks can't join societies. Freedom to associate is a thing, after all. \\n\\nThis isn't about party politics \u2013 it's about making the police fair and transparent. I've had a right old chat with loads of folks, and many agree we need to do something though not everyone is bold enough to speak up. I've done similar stuff with the Welsh Rugby Union before, so I know that saying something can spur real change. The idea is to balance police duties with transparency, making sure the public doesn't lose trust in them. \\n\\nMany of us, like teachers, already have to do these DBS checks, which is similar, isn't it? Some say politicians too should declare their memberships, and I'm all, 'yeah, why not?' It might remind you of the Welsh Assembly days when members had to declare being Freemasons or else face serious consequences. Now, they must declare any society memberships. It's smart and fair if you ask me. \\n\\nBeing part of clubs can be ace, building friendships and doing good, but not when they're used to hide wrongdoings.

First, quick shout-out to the Leader of the House for making this statement happen. Our committee clerk is thrilled because apparently we've set a new procedural record today, which is news to me, but hey! \ud83d\ude04\\n\\nThis report digs into the financial black hole that local councils are facing, especially when it comes to stuff like social care, education needs, and homelessness. We're trying to sound the alarm before the next financial settlement for local governments. Basically, councils are in a bind because they're spending more than they earn, and that wasn't always the case. In the last couple of decades, we had only eight councils in this predicament, but that's ballooned recently. And it's not just a few councils; it's happening everywhere! \ud83d\ude31\\n\\nThe big bad here is a massive funding gap worth billions. Council income just isn't keeping pace with rising service demands and inflation. In short, the current funding system is a mess, and successive governments cutting central grants isn't helping. Council tax has gone up 20%, but, overall, there's been an almost 26% drop in spending power since 2010.\\n\\nImmediate funding is a must. While the government announced \u00a3600 million more funding recently, it's not enough. Our report has some ideas on better funding reforms in the medium term, like giving councils more flexibility over how they spend.\\n\\nThe rise in costs mainly comes from adult and children\u2019s social care, education needs, and homelessness. We\u2019re pushing for funding increases and systematic overhauls across the board. On a lighter long-term note, increasing social housing could help with homelessness rather than just chucking money at temporary fixes.\\n\\nWe need whoever is in charge next to get serious about reforming local funding and taxes. Council tax and business rates need clarity and fairness. We suggest exploring options like different kinds of taxes or fiscal changes to really sort this mess out for good. Fingers crossed our recommendations make the financial debates next week, and future administrations give them the thought they deserve.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"Nigel Evans\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Thanks for that Clive.

Trade and food standards need a look-see. We need the government to ensure our standards are met and not a free-for-all.\\n\\n4. Dispute thingies?

I've got a plan for a new law that makes the Secretary of State come up with a plan for a social tariff on energy \u26a1\ufe0f. Back in 2022, the Government kept saying they'd protect energy consumers, maybe with social tariffs too. Sounds good, right? \ud83e\udd14 But we\u2019re in 2024 now and still waiting... \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f Not cool, especially for people with low incomes and disabilities who were freezing over Christmas and January. It's already tough for them as it is. \\n\\nI've brought this idea to protect those who need it most because the Government hasn\u2019t acted yet. Here's the thing: everyone agrees we need this. Disability groups, debt advice folks, politicians of all stripes, consumer groups, local councils, housing providers, watchdogs, even energy companies \u2013 they\u2019re all on board. Yet, nothing's happened! It's like the Government's ignoring them. This September, a huge group, including 150 organisations, reached out to the PM to get the ball rolling, but here we still are. \\n\\nSo, what the heck is a social energy tariff? It's basically a way to help out people who really need it by cutting down their energy bills. It'd be for folks with low incomes, disabilities, and anyone else really struggling to keep up with insanely high energy prices. Can you believe energy bills are up 61% since 2021? For some of the poorest, it feels more like last winter saw them spending half their income on energy! \\n\\nWhen I talked about this in November, it was great to see people from all parties agree. But then, the Government's response was 'meh' \u2013 like, two months after talking about it and nothing. They say energy bills aren't as bad this year, but tons of families are way behind on bills. According to Ofgem, record rates of energy debt are still a massive problem. The boss of Ofgem even said we should urgently think about a social tariff.\\n\\nSo, without any help from the Government this winter, many families had to choose between heating their homes and eating! Especially those with medical equipment that needs electricity. Just can\u2019t cut them off, right? \\n\\nBig charities like Age UK, Scope, and many more are saying this living cost crisis is hurting people bad, with millions of families wondering how they'll pay their bills. 1 in 8 households are in fuel poverty \u2013 that\u2019s 3.4 million families! And considering what people like Rhian, with terminal illnesses, are going through, the situation is dire. Rhian's heating is more expensive than her mortgage! \\n\\nHere's why social tariffs make sense\u2014it's not just about adding to warm home discounts or capping prices, but truly targeting those in need beyond just seeing who gets benefits. We should auto-enrol people needing help using data we\u2019ve already got. It should roll back prices to before this mess all started. And yeah, this isn\u2019t free. It has to be paid for fairly. General taxes seem the fairest way, and those who barely miss the support cut-off shouldn't be charged.\\n\\nThis social tariff is not just right morally, but financially smart too\u2014we save NHS cash on cold-related illnesses and boost spending in local economies! Lots of vulnerable households and organisations are really shouting for this, and it\u2019s the Government\u2019s job to hear them out and act. We need to look after the people who need it most. Let's get moving with this Bill. Support me in pushing this forward. People\u2019s lives depend on it.\ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udca1\\n\\nOh, and for anyone interested, the Bill's being backed by some awesome folks: Peter Aldous, John McDonnell, Cat Smith, and more.

It's crucial since 98% of all our food and agri-products move by road. Plus, the freight rates in the UK have shot up by 3.3% in just the last month of September. That's the fastest spike since December 2022, as per the TEG Road Transport Index. \ud83d\ude9a\ud83d\udcca The reintroduction of the HGV levy, clean air changes, and other rising business costs are definitely not helping. So, the people are asking the government to have a chat with the haulage industry to figure out how to keep them running and support them!\\n\"\n        }\n    ]\n}", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 581, "completion_tokens": 298, "total_tokens": 879}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_d794a2177f"}}, "error": null}

These 3.8 million women were unexpectedly told they'd have to wait four more years, until 66, to retire, messing up their financial planning big time! Some were even in poor health and taken early retirement expecting a pension by 60. \ud83d\ude1e\\n\\nIt's been nine long years of chat and brutal stories heard here, but zilch has happened in terms of help. The Government's ignored them, probably hoping they'll disappear, but they haven\u2019t. Unfortunately, 40,000 women are dying each year without any compensation and already, about 240,000 have passed away. And while these women struggle to enjoy retirement amidst the cost of living crisis, research says half can't even cover essential bills, and a quarter struggle with food expenses.\\n\\nBack in July 2021, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman said the government messed up big time by not communicating properly. But shocker, we're still fighting in 2023. The Tories, who were once loud supporters, have gone quiet, and Labour\u2019s too. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Even the Labour leader merely said they feel bad for these women, but words aren\u2019t enough.\\n\\nI'm urging the Labour leader to stand firm, grow a backbone, and promise compensation when in power. Sadly, the current shadow Work and Pensions Secretary hasn\u2019t mentioned a word about WASPI. \ud83d\ude29\\n\\nThe Ombudsman is taking an age to come up with a solution, though it's been nearly three years since acknowledging the screw-up. These delays just add stress to the already hurt women. As elections approach, the excuse remains that nothing can be done till PHSO concludes its work. Even when that happens, the Department for Work and Pensions might still deny wrongdoing, so we might need a push from Parliament.\\n\\nThe goal here is quick, sensible compensation\u2014not vast amounts. A fair deal using level 5 of the Ombudsman\u2019s scale minimum, ideally level 6, is achievable through this Bill. The WASPI women are practical\u2014no one's asking for the pension age to be lowered back to 60. Just don\u2019t forget the government saved \u00a3200 billion from raising the pension age to 66. \ud83d\udcb5\\n\\nSimple tax tweaks could fund the compensation easily in a couple of years. For example, ending the non-dom tax status could rake in \u00a33.6 billion annually, and aligning capital gains tax with income tax rates could bring \u00a310-15 billion yearly. Tackling fraud in PPE and covid support could also drum up funds. Yet, no 'VIP lane' for these women\u2014they can\u2019t even get a meeting with ministers.\\n\\nI've got tons of stories from constituents, like Ann, who got meningitis, retired at 60 without knowing about the pension age change, and ended up enduring six years without work or pension. Or Marie, whose husband got cancer, forcing her to work for seven extra years. \ud83d\ude1e\\n\\nThen there's Lesley, sometimes juggling three jobs to save for the future, now facing a six-year wait for her pension. Many would\u2019ve upped private pensions or NI contributions had they known, and some gave up holidays and more due to this oversight. But remember, these women are smart and capable, yet were ill-informed and now frustrated by the DWP's denials.\\n\\nTime to make up for past blunders like the miners' strike, Hillsborough cover-up, infected blood scandal, or the sub-postmaster scandal. These women deserve recognition for their unjust treatment in work, pay, and now pension. Big thanks to WASPI campaigners for sticking together. Together, we\u2019ll get some form of compensation, even if it won't erase the hurt entirely.\\n\\nThe Bill\u2019s ordered to be presented with the backing of numerous MPs from various parties, ready to be read again on April 19th (Bill 164). \ud83d\udcdc\"\n        }\n    ]\n}", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2448, "completion_tokens": 899, "total_tokens": 3347}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_2a322c9ffc"}}, "error": null}

Lately, we've seen some really nasty incidents of hate, and people being stopped from living their everyday lives. Yes, protesting is crucial in our democracy, but nasty stuff like throwing racist slurs, vandalising memorials, or intimidating with flares is just not on. We're putting a stop to this through new steps, like banning the use of protest as an excuse for criminal behaviour. If protesters are blocking roads or interfering with ambulances, their excuses won't wash anymore. People in the UK want a peaceful life without such disruptions. \\n \\nWe're also drafting measures against folks defacing war memorials, and those who hide their faces to avoid justice during protests. Flares will be banned\u2014if you're caught with them, you'll face serious consequences, including a fine or a short stint in jail. We brought in new laws a year ago to help police handle protests better, and since then, the police have made over 600 arrests to keep protests from getting out of hand. We owe a big thanks to our officers for their hard work in keeping us safe. Freedom of speech is key, but not when it crosses into violence or intimidation.

First off, I'm stepping in today for David Mundell, who lined up this debate. It's been 42 years since Terrence Higgins sadly passed. He was the first British person to die from HIV/AIDS and also one of our Commons reporters. We've come a long way since then in how we test, diagnose, and treat HIV. Now, people with HIV can live normal lives, but we can't forget it's still a big deal globally. Millions have it, and many more could get it. Catching it early is super important because it helps stop it spreading, helps people stay healthy, and can lessen the stigma (no shame in getting tested!). Big shoutout to charities like the Terrence Higgins Trust and the National AIDS Trust for all they do. They're rock stars in the fight. Also, a big thanks to Deborah Gold from the National AIDS Trust for all her hard work. She\u2019s been at it for a decade and deserves a round of applause. HIV messes with your immune system, weakening it against everyday stuff. It spreads from person to person and if left untreated, leads to AIDS. No cure yet, but treatments can give someone a good long life if diagnosed early. In 2022, the government rolled out an action plan aiming to slash new infections by 80% by 2025 and end them by 2030. But, we need proper funding for this. Exciting news! The Health Secretary is expanding the successful hospital testing program for HIV and hepatitis across England. This will help find undiagnosed cases and prevent new transmissions, which is exactly what we need. The campaign \u201cI test\u201d is back, encouraging everyone across the country to know their status by getting tested. Recent UK stats show that while diagnoses in white gay and bisexual men are down, other groups like heterosexual people and some ethnic minorities are seeing increased cases. This inequality has gotta go. Also, too many people with HIV aren't going to healthcare settings. Women and Black Africans are particularly hesitant. 40% of women eligible for testing didn\u2019t get offered it when visiting sexual health services last year. Minister, can you focus on fixing these disparities? There's also an issue with folks who know they have HIV but aren\u2019t getting care. Around 14,000 people in England haven\u2019t visited their clinic in over a year because of complex reasons like stigma. In London, more people not in care are filling up hospitals than those undiagnosed. Pilots in south London show getting people back into care is doable and cheaper than letting illnesses worsen. Can we have a national plan to find these people and give them the care they need? Late diagnosis really complicates things and is flat out dangerous.

About 3 million Brits hit up sexual health clinics each year\u2014you know, tons of acronyms like STIs, STDs, and HIV pop up. The first person in my family to do an HIV test was my mum after getting some blood units post-op. She was fine, but not everyone\u2019s so lucky. We need to chat more about person-to-person transmission. Look, celibacy isn't something we inherit, and most of us do have sex. Thankfully there's now a vaccine for genital warts that also helps protect men. I'm not an expert but more openness will help. Less stigma = more people knowing their status. Awareness is key.

Early diagnosis is up, and once diagnosed, people with HIV can live normal lives now, which seemed impossible 20 years back. Prevention's also improving, thanks to meds like PrEP. But it's frustrating we still have 4,500 undiagnosed cases in the UK. Unnecessary, right? Opt-out testing in places like A&E should be standard everywhere. More people testing means we can identify where disparities lie and tackle them. Clinics are under the pump with other STI outbreaks. Long waits mean folks can\u2019t even get the meds they need. It's daft if people who want PrEP can't get it due to appointment delays. These issues are clear, and fixing them isn't rocket science; it's about making resources available. Minister, please commit to expanding opt-out testing and ensure resources are allocated for PrEP availability. Why can't pharmacies handle PrEP distribution, taking the load off clinics?

In Northern Ireland, we\u2019ve had success with PrEP, and it's helped reduce the number of new diagnoses. In fact, numbers are dropping \u2014 a 49% decline since 2015! Testing's crucial, and HIV isn't the stigma-laden topic it once was. Our NHS does wonders; they\u2019ve turned what once scared folks into a treatable condition. But we need to keep young people aware, from schools to universities. These are the places they feel safe to have important health talks. Also, my constituency's linked up with missions that work in Africa, where cases are high. Thanks to medications, rates in places like Swaziland are more manageable now \u2013 an incredible turnaround. Minister, we must keep pushing these HIV awareness efforts forward.

Getting yourself tested during National HIV Testing Week is crucial. Science has come leaps and bounds in how we handle HIV. It's now a manageable condition, with those living with it enjoying full life expectancy. Plus \u2013 if your treatment's effective, you can't pass it on. Scotland set the mark as the UK\u2019s first to provide NHS-backed, free PrEP since 2017, and we\u2019ve got roughly 6,000 users. Yet, about 500 in Scotland remain undiagnosed, with almost 1,000 more diagnosed yet not accessing care. We need to reach them! Big changes have happened, especially for gay and bisexual men. But we need to push harder towards supporting other groups like women and minority communities. Stigma is real, and this affects testing. National HIV Testing Week\u2019s message hits home: knowing your status matters. UK aid initiatives have greatly helped too, but I\u2019m worried our drop to 0.5% GNI in aid sends the wrong message. Let\u2019s commit to ending HIV as a public health issue.

A huge credit goes to tireless activists, wonderful orgs like Terrence Higgins Trust, and all those memorable voices over the years. Labour's proud of our record, with key shifts like spending on available drugs post-1997 and the Equality Act of 2010. Hats off to Chris Smith and Lloyd Russell-Moyle for bravely speaking about their experiences with HIV here in Parliament! Yet, there\u2019s still work ahead. Around 4,500 folks in the UK are living with undiagnosed HIV, and 44% diagnosed last year were stage-late. Alarmingly, 51% of late-diagnosed cases are women, which is a deathbed kind of situation for some. We\u2019ve also seen a big dip in testing since 2019. Let\u2019s spread the word that testing is free, quick, and easy. You can even do it from home! I\u2019m thrilled the government is backing wider opt-out testing, and rolling it out beyond the pilots. Minister, how\u2019s the progress with the new hospitals getting this program? Will this be a long-term plan in the HIV-end-game? People testing positive through opt-out need good support. How about expanding to primary care? Two years on from the action plan, we need more updates on the progress made. Testing\u2019s vital, people are willing, but there are logjams in getting meds like PrEP. Let's talk long-term strategy. The Tories can\u2019t just talk about prevention\u2014let's see action! Lastly, given the changes to public health bodies, how can you honestly say prevention is still a priority?

We've made great progress; for instance, the UK\u2019s leading Europe in sexual and reproductive health rights\u2014go us! Still, we can\u2019t rest until we have zero transmissions. Testing\u2019s key, so we've kicked National HIV Testing Week up a notch to inspire as many tests as possible. We\u2019ve distributed nearly 100,000 self-test kits since launching the action plan, finding more cases to treat. Quick shoutout \u2013 I've taken the test too, just like many of you. Everyone should know their status; it\u2019s quick and simple! Despite falling new diagnosis rates, some groups remain higher risk\u2014like gay, bisexual men, and black Africans. Testing's uneven too\u2014more for men, less for others. Thanks to \u00a320 million funds, opt-out testing is in emergency departments in areas of very high HIV prevalence, helping us pinpoint undiagnosed cases. It\u2019s been such a success, catching over 4,000 undiagnosed blood infections! UK Research is putting another \u00a320 million into testing improvements, so we\u2019re working on this. LGBTQ+ advocacy is strong, and we have to break the stigma too. There\u2019s more to HIV than just testing; PrEP's crucial in preventing transmissions, being available since 2020. We're launching a PrEP road-map soon aiming to widen access. To smash the goal will require openness and support systems. Spread the word on how easy this is! It's an ambitious mission, but with great minds like Kevin Fenton and many in the fught, I\u2019m confident we can reach our 2030 goal.

This is like charging a poll tax on Scots who just wanna cheer for their national team without breaking the bank. \ud83c\udff4\u26bd\\n\\nI've been lucky to witness some incredible Scotland games in the past, and we've got a team full of talent like Andy Robertson and Scott McTominay. But too many Scots are stuck at home, unable to watch because it's all locked up behind Viaplay's paywall, which charges \u00a3180 a year. With everything else so expensive, that's a cost many just can't handle. It's not fair and not how it should be! \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\nIn lots of European countries, and even in other parts of the UK, such as England, matches are free to watch. Outside of major tournaments, even friendly matches in Scotland are behind Viaplay's paywall, unlike England's, which are on Channel 4 for everyone to see. Totally unfair, right?\\n\\nWomen\u2019s football and under-21 matches are no better. England\u2019s women\u2019s games are on big channels with wider reach, while Scotland\u2019s are tucked away on BBC Alba\u2014a channel not many can access. \u2696\ufe0f\\n\\nSome folks might blame the Scottish Football Association (SFA) for this situation, but I don\u2019t. They\u2019ve got to fund Scottish football at all levels, from grassroots to the national team. They sold the rights to Viaplay because it's how they get the necessary funding.\\n\\nInstead, the blame lies with UK broadcasters like the BBC and ITV. They seem happy to pay tons for England games but aren\u2019t willing to pay even a fraction for Scottish games, despite their obligation to Scottish viewers. Simon Pitts from STV told us it's because they don't see a big UK-wide commercial return\u2014what a cop-out, right?\\n\\nThis Bill is all about making it mandatory for Scottish matches to be broadcast free on TV, ensuring broadcasters stick to their duties. It's time Scots fans get what they deserve: access to watch and support their team on the big screen. \ud83d\udcfa\ud83d\udc4f\\n\\nThanks to my fellow MPs who are backing this Bill.

Wanted to give a quick update on the whole Ukraine situation as we're now approaching the two-year mark since Russia started their full-on invasion. I vividly remember the early morning of 24th February 2022. Got out of bed really early because Russia had just invaded Ukraine and by 6 am, I was off to a Cobra meeting. Back then, as the Transport Secretary, I chatted via Zoom with Oleksandr Kubrakov, my Ukrainian counterpart then. He was standing in a field outside Kyiv, not knowing how long the city could hold due to the Russian army being so close.\\n\\nFast forward to now, Ukraine has been pushing back! Russia's losing ground and a ton of resources, including 356,000 troops. (Yikes!) Ukraine has battered about 30% of Russia's Black Sea fleet, and half of the territory Russia tried to nab is back in Ukrainian hands. While Oleksandr leveled up to Deputy Prime Minister focusing on Ukraine's future restoration, Putin got it all wrong thinking he could wrap this up in days.\\n\\nWe in Britain have been right there with Ukraine, leading in global support. Remember our anti-tank missiles (NLAWs and Javelins)? They were sent even before things got really heated. Our impact has been huge: hit Putin hard with 2,700 tanks down, 5,300 armoured vehicles ruined, and loads more. We've sent 4 million rounds of ammunition, and thanks to our donation of 1,800 air defence missiles, Russia hasn't gotten air superiority like they thought.\\n\\nOh, and drones! We've sent 4,000 of those, showing how they're changing warfare's future. To keep ahead, the UK defence drone strategy was just launched, backed by \u00a3200 million, marking us as Ukraine's biggest drone friend.\\n\\nSea efforts? Yeah, we're going strong there too! Storm Shadows and other systems have helped Ukraine in the Black Sea. Trade has resumed stronger than before, with Ukraine exporting lots, including tonnes of agricultural products.\\n\\nPresident Zelensky really appreciates what we've been doing. We've sent 400 different types of equipment to Ukraine. True teamwork shows that when Ukraine gets what\u2019s needed, it can totally win!\\n\\nThe Prime Minister recently announced we're putting an extra \u00a32.5 billion into our military support for Ukraine. That\u2019s over \u00a37 billion spent on military aid alone, and \u00a312 billion total, counting humanitarian and economic support too!\\n\\nJust today, I'm excited to announce another 200 Brimstone anti-tank missiles heading to Ukraine. They've been super effective on the ground.\\n\\nWe've also got an international fund for Ukraine that's pledged over \u00a3900 million, shipping out state-of-the-art drones, electronic warfare, and more.\\n\\nAnd let's not forget training. We've trained over 60,000 Ukrainians here in the UK, and our training mission's expanding. Even countries like Kosovo, Estonia, and many more are hopping on board to help train Ukrainian troops.\\n\\nOn the sea front, we're teaming up with Norway and other countries in a maritime coalition to boost Ukraine\u2019s naval capabilities, sending mine detection drones, raiding craft, and more Sea King choppers.\\n\\nI even announced a new drone coalition effort alongside Latvia to scale up providing FPV drones to Ukraine and support drone schools and test range setups. \u00a3200 million has already been earmarked for this, making us Ukraine\u2019s go-to for drone gear.\\n\\nBeyond all this, we\u2019ve initiated a task force to develop a strong defence industrial partnership with Ukraine, looking to back them for years to come. We've already set the groundwork with a new security cooperation agreement for what we hope will be an enduring alliance.\\n\\nUkraine's proved they have the will; they just need the tools to finish the job. Russia's still pushing, bombing places like hospitals in Avdiivka, but with 30% of their federal budget now focused on defence... that's a hefty increase.\\n\\nPutin's banking on us getting tired, but we're not going to let that happen. We\u2019re all standing strong with Ukraine and ensuring they get the support to win this. Big cheers to the UK and freedom-loving nations pulling together on this one.

It's a perfect mix of towns and villages among open spaces. The local planning is run by the Liberals (who are ironically not so liberal in planning) and we're stuck with an outdated 2009 plan. That's putting us at risk from developers, cause we don't have a fresh plan like 90% of other councils.\\n\\nBack in 2019, the Liberals took control and whipped up a plan allowing like 30+ green-belt areas to be developed. Locals were *not* happy, and rightly so. Most of these green areas could be saved by building smarter on other sites instead. Come election time, Liberals promised to protect the green belt and then did a U-turn. Instead of thinking outside the box or removing green-belt sites from the plan, they stubbornly kept them in. This has led to developers winning appeals to build on these spaces, against residents' wishes.\\n\\nI'm urging our leaders to stress how crucial it is to keep the green belt under protection. The green belt should only be developed in *truly* exceptional circumstances, none of which should include housing!

This is the first time I\u2019ve drawn a good spot for a private Member\u2019s Bill, and I\u2019m really chuffed because I\u2019ve got something important to present. This Bill is about cracking down on strategic litigation against public participation cases, or SLAPPs. These are the legal cases aimed at shutting people up. Last year, both I and Labour were happy with the steps taken in the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 to tackle SLAPPs around economic crime, but we need to extend that protection. SLAPPs are bad news for free speech and public interest, and it\u2019s a massive issue across all kinds of situations. Let's see if I can give you a few examples. You might have heard about Tom Burgis and his book \u2018Kleptopia\u2019. Yeah, a mining company from Kazakhstan kicked off a lawsuit against him. Then there was the whole Roman Abramovich thing against Catherine Belton about her book \u2018Putin\u2019s People\u2019. And there are tons of other stories like these where big shots try to keep bad stuff under wraps. But it\u2019s not just famous people. How about Nina Cresswell, who got sued just for naming the person who attacked her? And what about patients who leave bad reviews or tenants who speak up about awful living conditions? These lawsuits can be used to bully them into silence. At the end of the day, SLAPPs aren\u2019t just about the courtroom; they start way before anyone even gets there with scary legal letters. We've got some figures showing SLAPPs are on the rise, but I reckon they barely show the real scale of the issue.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"Richard Foord\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Hey, quick one: that coalition you mentioned thinks your Bill's introducing a subjective test, meaning judges will have to figure out the mindset of the person filing these lawsuits.

By introducing my Bill, I hope to fix this imbalance and give people the legal backing they need to speak up without fear. Although protecting against SLAPPs shouldn't mean claimants lose their rights, the system can't be skewed against truth-tellers either.

Such lawsuits burden people with legal costs they cannot manage. This Bill, which also has the support of the Government, would stop them in their tracks. Other countries, like the US and in Europe, are doing something similar. So we best get our skates on, or we\u2019ll be left behind. More places are rejecting SLAPPs, so the UK could become the go-to for these cases if we don\u2019t act now.

This should apply to both adults and kids to keep things consistent. Why is this important? Well, it's about managing risks effectively!

I'm supporting this Bill because it's fair to expect offenders to report any changes in their details, just like those leaving prison have to.

It's crucial because they own more than 2,700 properties worth over \u00a33 billion, including 10% of all NHS facilities. I'm especially concerned about how this is managed regarding Seaton Community Hospital in my area. NHS Property Services is government-owned with the Secretary of State for Health as the only shareholder. This should mean ministers are responsible, but it seems they're avoiding saying that! They act like they can't touch it, which is weird because they're supposed to oversee it. The real kicker is the super high rent they charge \u2013 like \u00a3140 per square metre, way more than what you'd pay here in Westminster. This ridiculous rent makes it impossible for local groups to use these spaces for health and well-being. NHS Property Services seem more focused on making cash than improving health, which doesn't help places like Seaton Hospital. Local groups actually raised money for these buildings, and now they'd have to pay crazy amounts just to use them. I've got three questions for the Minister: 1. Does the Department set the rental costs? 2. Can those costs be changed by ministers? 3. If yes, why are ministers saying they can't do anything about it? This isn't just about Seaton; it's happening in many community hospitals. It's time we got some flexibility in rental fees. \ud83e\udd1e\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"Andrew Stephenson\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Big shoutout to Richard for starting this chat. I totally get why stuff like the future of Seaton Community Hospital has everyone's attention. Just like Richard, I fought to keep a cherished hospital open in my area. NHS Property Services came about when we needed someone else to manage properties instead of local NHS teams. They ended up owning nearly 3,500 places! Over the last decade, they\u2019ve shrunk that estate by a fifth, saving over half a billion which went back into the NHS. When properties get sold, the cash doesn't get pocketed by the government; it stays within healthcare to keep things running. The government can\u2019t just meddle in every small decision; that's why NHS Property Services is set up to be independent. The board makes the decisions, not us MPs or ministers. About Seaton, they\u2019re working with local health groups to sort out rents and find other uses for the buildings. It's not going up for sale or anything drastic like demolition, so the community can breathe easy. Their future will depend on what local groups propose by June 2024. Here's hoping they find a solid plan by then! \ud83d\ude07\"\n        }\n    ]\n}", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 5106, "completion_tokens": 568, "total_tokens": 5674}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_2a322c9ffc"}}, "error": null}

When this goes into effect, convictions will be cancelled without anyone needing to apply. \\nThis is some pretty heavy stuff, and nothing like this has ever been done before. But this scandal is just as unique, so we're going big on the solution. We've got great support from the Horizon compensation advisory board too, and are making sure that compensation gets out fast. We're working with tons of folks who were affected to make sure they get the cash they deserve quickly. For those with full assessment routes, it might take longer, but we're topping up interim payments, like bumping it to \u00a3450,000 from \u00a3163,000, to help keep things moving.\\nWe're doing our best to make first offers of compensation both full and fair.

We\u2019ve got parents like Zoey and Theresa Cave, whose son Chris was killed, all pushing for change. They're doing incredible work trying to fix the culture around knives among young folks. But look, allowing inmates to have unchecked social media access is just plain dangerous. It fuels the spread of fake news and radical ideas, so we need to slam the brakes on this. As per gov.uk rules, prisoners shouldn\u2019t have mobile phones or access to social media. Yet, the reality is far from it. It\u2019s no surprise these rules get ignored. That needs to change!\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"Jim Shannon\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Great stuff bringing up this issue!

More needs to be done to bust these social media antics from jail. We gotta ask what\u2019s being done to stop Jack\u2019s murderer from getting at his family on Facebook.

The Ministry of Justice is striving to get all prison-related harmful content quashed quickly from the net. Rules are strong on illegal phone ownership inside, with tight penalties. But we must support the Prison Media Bill, closing any gaps, so inmates can't share clips or content from prison. Security investment increased, marking over 46,000 contraband finds with airport-style checks in place. Prisons are bringing in initiatives from VR gear for job training to music workshops to positively engage young offenders, transforming lives.

We're talking about a plan where grads from certain courses might not have to pay back their student loans if they work in the UK in specific jobs for a certain time. First, I want to remember Lord Patrick Cormack, a big name from my hometown, Great Grimsby. \\n\\nNow to business - our education system should not just focus on getting good marks but should also be about building the workforce we need for tomorrow. We've had loads of reports saying we're missing key skills from workers. With the government needs top-quality public services, we should look at how we fund uni degrees, both for students and postgrads. \ud83d\udcda\\n\\nBefore Parliament, I spent 22 years in education, and it seems to me that the current funding push might not actually benefit all students. Too many folks are persuaded to get degrees that may not suit them or help in their careers. Labour\u2019s old policies meant more people ended up in uni, but a lot studied degrees with less impact. \ud83d\udcd5\\n\\nIn the UK, we don't have enough of the right skills, leading to us getting talent from abroad \u2013 and we pay for it! If our grads leave the UK, we lose that investment, which is silly, right? \ud83e\udd14 By 2030, the skills shortage could cost \u00a3120 billion, and our workforce will be short by 2.5 million skilled workers.\\n\\nEach year we spend \u00a320 billion on these courses, but grads only start paying their loans back when earning around \u00a321k to \u00a327k. A rethink is needed so students pick degrees that matter. Right now, student debt is about \u00a3100 billion and could skyrocket to \u00a31.2 trillion by 2049. Only 27% of grads pay off their loans fully. Plus, many grads regret going to uni as it doesn\u2019t improve their career prospects. \\n\\nDespite having more grads than ever, 83% of big companies still need more skilled workers. Even doctors aren\u2019t sticking around in the NHS, which is losing \u00a3220k per student doctor annually. We need a better funding system to keep doctors and other professionals in the UK services.\\n\\nHere's my idea: a \" \n                    ,\"**British GradForce agreement**.\"  :  \"It\u2019s like a contract with the government for students studying in shortage areas where, in return for working in specified jobs for a few years, their loans could get scrapped. The armed forces use a similar scheme for decades \u2013 why can\u2019t we? \\n\\nWe need a list showing public service skill shortages. Unis can then align courses to these shortages, and students could volunteer to take on these jobs afterward. As a thank you, they\u2019d get their student debt canceled after meeting service time. \ud83c\udf93\\n\\nIt\u2019s all about pushing folks towards high-demand sectors, cutting student debt, and giving taxpayers value for money while also boosting growth and productivity.

I've personally been to Ghana and Canada with their help, and it's super important we keep building these relationships.

We've supported them for ages for good reason.\\n\\nSo, about this money resolution \u2013 we're totally on board. From what I gather, it doesn't cost us much more than what we're already spending on similar international things. There have been hiccups with CPA getting special privileges and immunities, so we must back this move ASAP. Otherwise, we might lose the CPA secretariat from the UK, which would suck.\\n\\nAnd it's crucial we give the ICRC the same privileges other countries do so they can keep their good work confidential and neutral.

It's a real sore spot.\\n\\nLooking back to 1939, the ICRC tried to check in on Jews taken to Poland by the Nazis but got blocked. Instead of pushing back, the Red Cross kinda backed off that issue during WWII, with awful results. They\u2019ve said sorry in hindsight, and we've kept supporting them financially. But right now, families are upset because their loved ones are missing and the Red Cross isn't really able to help. The ICRC president told Israel's PM pressing Hamas wasn\u2019t going to work, which is beyond frustrating. Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister even said if the Red Cross can't help the hostages, it might as well pack it up.\\n\\nThere was even a meeting with hostage families where the Red Cross rep told them to think about the Palestinians. Seriously?? Imagine saying that to a trauma victim \ud83e\udd14. People have been protesting outside ICRC offices in the US, demanding Red Cross action in Gaza.

In my area around Selby and Ainsty, we're seeing way too many crashes because of fast drivers and lack of speed control \u26a0\ufe0f. Between 2018 and 2022, we had 36 tragic deaths, and it's only second to Skipton and Ripon nearby.\\n\\nWe've got roads meant for quieter times running right through villages; it's scary stuff. Recently, someone lost their life crossing the busy A63 in Hambleton. This road's right by homes and a school yet cars zoom past at crazy speeds \ud83d\ude13. Local folks made a safety group, but they need more support. Minister, any tips on how communities can push for changes?\\n\\nHonestly, road safety talk in North Yorkshire's been hijacked by pointless debates thanks to the Conservatives. They're resisting 20 mph zones, saying they aren't needed. Meanwhile, people in areas like Cawood and Sherburn in Elmet just want to walk around their own areas without fear.

In Monk Fryston, folks are pushing for a crossing on A64 with no results because the council claims there's 'nowhere suitable'. Really?\\n\\nWe shouldn't have to wait for disasters to drive action. I\u2019m asking again: Minister, help us make these changes happen, please! And in places like Cawood, speeding is out of control. Just had an event there, and everyone\u2019s concerned about it.

We help them with guides to make roads safer, and they decide what's best, like adding 20 mph zones when needed.\\n\\nKeir mentioned some stats showing how road injuries have decreased since 2009, even though Labour was running the show then \ud83e\udd13.

It's a big win from recent government funding decisions.

Policing must root out anyone not fit to wear the badge, with an automated system to spot dodgy behaviour quicker. Suspensions for police charged with specific crimes will be automatic. And there's more to come.\\n\\nRemember, tackling violence against women is as important as tackling terrorism. We've got plans and funding backing this up. Rapists will serve full sentences, no early release. Our safer streets initiative and the StreetSafe tool are just part of it. My commitment is unwavering: we must restore confidence in the police.

I've mentioned it like a gazillion times in Parliament, so thanks for listening to my ramblings once more! A little history: St Helier has been around since the early 40s and was a lifeline long before the NHS came into existence. It even survived bombings during WWII!\\n\\nA massive shoutout to our incredible NHS staff who make magic happen every day. Whether you're a doctor, nurse, pharmacist, or one of the unsung heroes like porters and cleaners, thank you tons! \ud83d\udc4f\\n\\nBefore I got elected, I was all about making sure healthcare in my area got the love it deserved. I'm thrilled that we're getting a shiny new hospital and well-deserved upgrades to St Helier, all thanks to the Conservative Government. Some people just don\u2019t see the good work being done, which is unfortunate.\\n\\nQuick backstory: The Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals Trust worked with the NHS since 2017 to plan for these improvements. In May 2023, Steve Barclay said our shiny new facilities would be ready by 2030. So, we need more funds for things like land and preparing new sites, which is super urgent!\\n\\nDon't believe any rumours about St Helier closing \u2013 it's not! We'll have two hospitals in Sutton, catering to different medical needs. This is the biggest investment in healthcare here in ages, so let's get cracking!\\n\\nQuick note to the Minister: would love to have you visit and see the exciting plans we have.

We\u2019ve also released over \u00a31 million this year to help prep the site for building. Demolition and groundwork at Sutton are set to kick off soon and we'll keep everyone updated.\\n\\nMore good news: the Trust got \u00a37.3 million for moving services to Epsom General Hospital, ready since August 2023, and \u00a36.1 million for upgrading A&Es. Let's also talk about the wider hospital programme\u2014our new hospitals, like the Royal Liverpool and Northern Centre for Cancer Care, are already up and running. More are on the way soon!\\n\\nSticking to our goals, we\u2019re giving clinical staff next-level facilities to work better and stay happier.

People deserve a government that\u2019s open and accountable, and that's exactly what we need to work on because things are getting a bit too secretive for my liking. \ud83e\udd14\\n\\nHere\u2019s the deal: Our democracy hinges on a good relationship between Parliament and the civil service. When they work well together, we've done amazing things like beat fascism, build the NHS, and win the Olympic bid! But when things are tense, you get dodgy decisions on WMDs and weak PPE contracts. It mucks up good policies, you know?\\n\\nWe've got some fantastic people in both Parliament and the civil service, but things have been a bit tense recently, which isn\u2019t great for running the country. The Sue Gray situation was shocking \u2013 a civil servant investigating the Prime Minister and then leaving to join the Opposition? \ud83d\ude33 That doesn't sit right.\\n\\nThe issue we have is that those in high power like Permanent Secretaries are often like ghosts. People with power should be known and accountable. At the moment, the Prime Minister gets to pick them from a list, but can anyone actually name these people? Probably not without a quick Google.\\n\\nThis isn't just about Permanent Secretaries; it\u2019s anyone with major power, like top NHS chiefs. A lot can go wrong if officials think they\u2019re above democratic instructions. Right now, promotions often depend on pleasing certain elite networks instead of serving the public.\\n\\nI\u2019ve got a chill solution, nothing drastic. It\u2019s about getting back to British roots, making the process less cosy with the Executive, and more in line with Parliament. Let's have a cross-party committee for these appointments \u2013 it\u2019s fixed-term, no lifetime jobs here! This only affects a few dozen people but could change the culture for the better at the top.\\n\\nSome reckon we just need Select Committees to meet more, or ministers to get better training. But honestly, if folks have real power but don't answer to Parliament, these ideas won't fix much. What I'm suggesting is doable and could gently tweak and modernise how we work. If we don\u2019t sort this now, we might need bigger changes down the line. Let's keep our government gold standard and not let it turn into something that just fools people.\\n\\nAlright, so this Bill is being put forward with the help of Michael Fabricant, Andrew Rosindell, and Mr Mark Francois, to be talked about again on 17 May.

So, I\u2019m excited to present this new Bill aimed at helping folks all over the country. Life's hard enough with the soaring costs of living. People are struggling to pay their broadband bills, which means many can\u2019t access essential public services online. Imagine having to choose between heating and internet data!\ud83d\ude1f\\n\\nThere\u2019s some shocking data: by October 2023, nearly 2 million households were finding it tough to cover their broadband costs. That\u2019s nearly double from the previous year! And if you're on universal credit, you\u2019re four times more likely to be behind on your broadband bill. Can you believe that? Almost one in six struggle to keep up. It's way harder for them to even manage their universal credit accounts!\\n\\nThis digital age is great because we can access loads of services online, especially since the pandemic taught us all how important online services are. Over a billion people were checking out NHS webpages in a year during the pandemic \u2013 that\u2019s mad! These online resources make life easier and services cheaper for us taxpayers. But it shouldn't be a 'luxury' to access something like the NHS website just because your finances are tight. \\n\\nDuring the pandemic, companies like Vodafone, EE, and Virgin Media offered free access to important sites like the NHS. That\u2019s called zero-rating. \ud83c\udd93 I\u2019m suggesting we make this a permanent thing so that folks can always access essential sites like gov.uk and nhs.uk for free, no matter what. \ud83d\udcbb This small change can take the edge off for those who rely heavily on mobile data.\\n\\nHere in Wakefield, we have this awesome group, Wakefield Technology 4 All, that gives out laptops and helps with digital access. Real stories, like one woman who needed help after tough times, show how crucial it is to get online. No one should have to worry about running out of data to sort their life out. We want this to be an easy fix, and it\u2019s doable because it's been done before! \\n\\nProblem's not completely solved with this, but it's a step in the right direction. Big shout-out to all working hard on digital inclusion. Together, we can help bridge the digital divide and make sure everyone has the same access to important online services, regardless of their situation.
