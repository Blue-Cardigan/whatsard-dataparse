The one from the Leader of the Opposition kicks things off, and there are a couple more from Stephen Flynn and Ed Davey wrapping things up. Over to the shadow Home Secretary.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"James Cleverly\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Alright, here's our take on the state of things: we're moving an amendment because the King's Speech is missing some big commitments. We're talking about upping defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030, really dealing with those channel crossings, and giving rural areas like ours the attention they deserve. Scrumptious as it sounds, we need £1 billion more for UK agriculture. Businesses are getting new responsibilities, but they need support too—to cut the unsustainable welfare growth and protect people’s finances as we shift to net zero. Energy security matters, and we've got to keep things rosy for pensioners and workers. \\n\\nI welcomed the Home Secretary yesterday and applauded her team. They’ve got civil servants ready to back them in safeguarding our country. Honestly, people who didn’t make the cut this time, like Stephen Kinnock, are a loss. But hey, I’m excited to see what Dame Diana Johnson as the Home Affairs Minister can pull off. And Jess Phillips? Well, she's right up her alley with her new role, handling victims and safety. Violence against women was my priority, and I can't wait to collaborate with her. \\n\\nThe general election highlighted the essential work of defending our democracy, and hats off to Tom Tugendhat for leading that charge. We're standing constructive, against election violence. The defending democracy taskforce has pressing work. The honeymoon's over for the Home Secretary though. Seven days in, she’s already quirked things up! Cancelling the Rwanda plan? It's messing up our crackdown on smuggler gangs. It’s clear Labour plans go against the promises of the past—and that’s something we need to sort. Also, there’s been a mixed bag of results from Labour's Home Secretary, let’s see how she fares going forward.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"Yvette Cooper\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Can I interrupt you there?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"James Cleverly\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"We’ll hear from her soon. So far, 500 asylum seekers came in boats last week, and over 2,000 since Labour took charge. The second week's outlook isn't much better.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"Yvette Cooper\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Could he clarify something?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"James Cleverly\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Hold on, you'll have your turn. Riots in Leeds happened on Labour’s watch. And Neil Basu's opt-out from the so-called border command hints at Labour's lax migration policies. We've stomped out 100 criminals, but Labour, they voted against the legislation we used. Their tough talk, when scrutinized, lacks substance.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"Yvette Cooper\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Thanks for bringing me down from fantasyland. Under your watch, migration tripled and boat crossings broke records. You've shelled £700 million on a Rwanda scheme. How many have you sent there?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"speakername\": \"James Cleverly\",\n            \"rewritten_speech\": \"Oh, plucking numbers isn't your strong suit. We had planes ready; it was scrapped! Telling Rwanda through tabloids? That was a blunder. Using Rwanda as a model of diplomacy? I think not. Labour's so-called border security mimics our plans minus real results. Look, last year alone, we returned 25,000 folks to their home countries. Labour’s border plans tout what already exists. How effective, honestly? Journeying through EU for more migrants is a reverse of what should be done. Holding Labour accountable, here meant serious talk, not just efficiency buzzwords.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
